## Lab 4 - Infrastructure as Code

This lab concerns implementing cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
tools. It allows you to manage cloud setup using code tools, enabling automation,
reproducibility, Git versioning, and more. This is very important for any application
that is not trivial proof-of-concept. We will use Terraform, as the most popular IaC
tool.

**Learning plan**
1. Terraform basics, HCL language
2. State management
3. Cloud providers for Terraform
4. Modules and reusable code

**Necessary software**
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
- AWS account
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

**Lab & homework**

In this lab, there is no separate homework. Laboratory instructions are long and also act
as a homework. See the [lab instruction](LAB_INSTRUCTION.md).
